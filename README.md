# The-Simon-Game

Game play: 
when the page is loaded, a sequence is generated for the user to follow.
At every level, only the last step is shown by the program. The user has to remember the pattern from the beginning of the game.
If the user gets one of the steps wrong, the program will display "Game over" message, and prompt the user to press a key.
When user does so, it will start over again.
